## Key Findings from Recent Research

1. Toby Ord's "The Precipice" (2020)
   - Estimated cumulative existential risk this century: ~1/6
   - Highest risks: unaligned AI, engineered pandemics
   - Emphasis on anthropogenic risks over natural ones

2. IPCC Reports (2021-2022)
   - Increased certainty of human-caused warming
   - Identification of irreversible tipping points
   - Critical thresholds for ecosystem collapse

3. World Economic Forum Global Risks Report 2024
   - Emphasis on interconnected nature of risks
   - Growing importance of technological threats
   - Climate action failure as persistent top risk

4. Biological Weapons Convention Review Conference
   - Increasing accessibility of synthetic biology
   - Dual-use research concerns
   - Detection and attribution challenges

## Research Gaps and Limitations

1. Quantification Challenges
   - Difficulty in assessing probability of unprecedented events
   - Limited historical data for novel risks
   - Complex system interactions

2. Interdisciplinary Integration
   - Need for better integration of social and technical analysis
   - Gaps between academic research and policy implementation
   - Challenges in risk communication

3. Emerging Technologies
   - Rapid pace of development outstripping research
   - Limited understanding of long-term implications
   - Difficulties in experimental assessment
