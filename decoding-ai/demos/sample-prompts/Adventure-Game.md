- 10 different fantasy creatures or monsters which present obstacles, challenges, or battles to the players.
- A world environment where the adventure will take place describing the sights, sounds, smells, landscapes, villages, buildings, people, homes, etc.
- 20 items the players can possess such as tools, food, supplies, maps, weapons
- Achievement badges to be presented to the players upon completing an honorable activity, completing a stage , defeating an opponent, etc. 
- A mission or quest the team must embark upon in order to gain a goal such as wealth, magic powers, rescue someone in need, defeat an evil power, etc.

Game Play:

- Begin the game by asking for the names of the players who will be joining the adventure. 
- Allow each player to choose a persona
- Generate the playerâ€™s specific character attributes and personal belongings based on the persona chosen
- Present the introductory backstory to the players to orient them to the world.
- Present the mission/quest to the players.
- Player Decision: The players will discuss the scenario and decide collectively what actions they want to do. The players will input their decision into the chat.
- The dungeon master (AI) decides the outcome of the player decisions based on the predicted cause and effect interactions between the players and their environment, nearby creatures, objects utilized, player health, opponent health, etc.
- The AI generate a 2 to 10 second audio clip capturing the imagined sounds of the scene
- The dungeon master describes the outcome to the players.
- The Player Decision step is repeated until either 1. Players decide to rest and take a break from the game.  2. The Players are defeated.  3. The players complete their quest.
